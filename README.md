### Overview

Our latest client, BeerBuddy , requested a simple ReactJS web application to showcase their vast beer
selection.
Users can view the beers in cards and see the beer information in a modal that opens when
clicking on a card.
Users can mark their favorite beers and view them on a different page.
Users can filter beers by food pairing using a free text field.
